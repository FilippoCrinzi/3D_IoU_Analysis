# Performance Evaluation of Clustering Algorithms

This project implements an algorithm to quantitatively evaluate
the performance of clustering algorithms applied to point clouds.
The main goal is to compare the position, orientation, and shape
of detected vehicles against their real representation in 
simulated scenarios.
